# not-open-source
Yeah, the project you we're looking for isn't open source.

Maybe it's a project I made for someone, or something I made but cannot opensource it.

I do not like I need to do this, but. It's not open source.

Though maybe in the future I'll release it opensource, or a remake if I am not allowed to release the version because of other things.

Thank you for understanding!
